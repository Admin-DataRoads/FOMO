# FOMO
Forward Operating Mesh Observer (FOMO)

An orchestration of different powered-wire and wireless technologies for multichannel Cooperative Multiple Input Multiple Output (Co-MIMO) array mesh orchestration, at the leading edge of communities in need of better or more competitive infrastructure. 

This exploits the physics of light that dictate at similar given power levels, radios (or emitters and detectors for light outside of human-visible range) that transmit and sense at lower frequencies (or wider wavelengths) convey lower data bandwidth, but penetrate farther across more mediums with less attenuation. Conversely, radios at higher frequencies (or smaller wavelengths) convey much higher data bandwidth, but attenuate in all mediums (including "free" air) at much closer distances. Similarly, phased antenna arrays and virtual antennae require wider spacing when coordinating wider wavelength signals, and beamforming antenna arrays at small wavelengths can be packed into much smaller spaces. Additionally, wires that convey electrical power can also act as waveguides or direct conductors for broad bands of high data bandwidth capability, such that both data and power can be shared between any generation and storage nodes on the same wired mesh, where shorter wires can convey more data and power with less loss than longer wires.

At the software layer, this exploits recent technology developments in mesh routing and Co-MIMO multi-radio orchestration, utilizing hardware backends with new Software Defined x technologies (or SDx, where x is any technology that used to be the sole province of custom hardware and ASIC designs). In the near term, SDR (radio) and SDN (network) technologies are the most useful technologies for novel Co-MIMO mesh SDA (antenna) coordination. Developments in power microgrid controllers will similarly create SDP (power) systems which can be exploited for microgrid connections between residential renewable power and storage systems.

# Example Mesh
For a more concrete example hybrid SDP-SDN-SDR-SDA mesh with multichannel Co-MIMO orchestration, let's define some nodes with existing power wire connections and ISM/unlicensed band sharing technologies:

Solar and small-wind DC generation nodes, optionally with DC battery storage, connected via <=10Gbps and <=90W USB-C and 60GHz 802.11ad WiGig at <=10m spacings between nodes across rooftops.

Aggregated DC to 120VAC power inverter nodes, optionally with AC battery storage (eg. Tesla Powerwalls) or backup low-carbon generators (eg. biodiesel or wind tower turbines), connected via <=10Gbps ethernet, Power over Ethernet (PoE), ~6GHz 802.11ac MU-MIMO WiFi, and HomePlug AV2 2Gbps MIMO 15A powerlines at <=100m spacing between nodes in garages and basements. Each power and data line may convey up to 1800W and 10Gbps maximum, or 100W and 1Gbps at the low end (LTPoE++). HomePlug AV2 2Gbps 1800W connections between nodes could stretch as long as 300m. These nodes may also act as gateways to older or longer-distance infrastructure like multi-KW grids and multi-km <=100Gbps fiber.

~5.8GHz 802.11ac MU-MIMO WiFi nodes receiving wired power and data from one of the above node types, and orchestrating Co-MIMO radio mesh arrays at about 17m spaced increments. Due to the prevalence of multi-band 802.11ac/n WiFi COTS routers on the market that can run OpenWRT/LEDE distributions, this node type will likely be combined with the above and below node types.

~2.4GHz 802.11n MU-MIMO WiFi nodes receiving wired power and data from one of the above node types, and orchestrating Co-MIMO radio mesh arrays at about 35m increments. Due to the prevalence of multi-band 802.11ac/n WiFi COTS routers on the market that can run OpenWRT/LEDE distributions, this node type will likely be combined with the above node types.

~900MHz 802.11ah LoRAWAN nodes receiving wireless power and data from one of the above node types, or local micro-generation and battery storage, and coordinating Co-MIMO radio mesh arrays at about 100-300m increments. Due to the prevalence of low-cost SDR designs in the sub-GHz range, this node type will likely be combined with below node types. Gateways to >2GHz radio meshes will likely be combined with above node types.

~150MHz MURS nodes receiving wireless power and data from one of the above node types, or local micro-generation and battery storage, and orchestrating Co-MIMO radio mesh arrays at about 1.5km increments. Due to the prevalence of low-cost SDR radio designs in the sub-GHz range, this node type will likely be combined with 900MHz and below node types. Gateways to >500MHz radio meshes will likely be combined to above node types. While at first glance MURS regulatory limitations don't lend themselves to mesh data networking, low power MURS non-forwarding meshes still allow the higher bandwidth mesh types above to communicate geographic, timing, cryptographic key, PKI authentication, SMS-alike text block, and other meta data directly across mesh clusters that have no other direct data communication channels. This capability will greatly assist Web of Trust metric discovery and inter-mesh-cluster authentication systems, help them avoid Man in the Middle (MitM) attack vectors, and can serve as a standardized Serval Mesh or similar text communications system during disaster recovery.

SDR capable nodes will make it possible to coordinate Co-MIMO arrays of radios using above ISM node meshes for licensed and "light licensed" bands -- for example whitespaces, satellite K bands, UAV or balloon nodes, 3.6GHz security meshes, and licensed cellular pico stations or relays. SDR GPS and GLONASS receivers will also allow all nodes to more precisely coordinate unique node IP numbering and antenna phase timing without outside DHCP or NTP style interventions. Nodes lacking any direct GPS or GLONASS signals can be fed precise location and time data by 3 or more neighbor nodes via signal latency based triangulation. Noisy frequencies can also be pseudorandomly sampled by the SDR to generate cryptographically secure random numbers as needed.

Mobile device clients can be created that will simultaneously utilize all 6 unlicensed radio bands listed above, minimally in 2x2 MIMO configurations to traverse 2+ neighbor static nodes during travel without transition loss, optionally with low power 2x2 MIMO SDR antennae that can dynamically utilize other cellular licensed and "light licensed" bands in local mesh use. GPS and aGPS mobile devices can benefit from the same signal latency based triangulation methods for greater geolocation and UTC atomic time precesion.
